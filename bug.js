This error occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a local image URI that is not correctly formatted.  The URI may be missing the `file://` prefix or contain incorrect characters.

**Example of incorrect URI:**
`/path/to/image.jpg`

**Example of correct URI:**
`file:///path/to/image.jpg`

This leads to the image not being displayed, and potentially no error message in the console making it difficult to debug.
